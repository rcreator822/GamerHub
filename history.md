## History of Gamer Hub

Before I was using GitHub and had co-creators, I was learning HTML on my Mac und using TextEdit. At my school, there
was a coding club that used Code.org. I made the first version of Gamer Hub there (Then called Gamer Realm. Don't
judge.) I also made a second version of Gamer Realm that kinda lost it's theme. My third project was the first Gamer
Hub. It looked a lot different then. You can download that version [here](https://ghgames.netlify.app/old/). At my school I relized that Gamer Hub
needed a better interface and therefor created this website. Hope you enjoyed your lesson!
